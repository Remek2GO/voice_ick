## Voice Control Module for Tiny Creatures

This project is part of a larger initiative to develop a multimodal game called **Tiny Creatures**. The goal of our team is to create a module that enables players to control their character using voice commands.

Our voice control module will allow for an immersive and interactive gaming experience, leveraging speech recognition technology to provide seamless character control. This feature will be a core component of the multimodal gameplay experience in **Tiny Creatures**.
